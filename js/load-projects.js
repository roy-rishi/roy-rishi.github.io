These systems, paired with specialized mechanics, will work together to drive the robot at the high speeds and extreme precision that playing the violin demands. Through this project, I am developing software and mechanical systems that advance my skills in robotics.

It rapidly slides alongst the length of the string, controlling the pitch by contacting the string with a roller. Given the need for both speed and extreme precision, this was the most challenging aspect of the robot's mechanics. It is belt-driven and powered by two stepper motors. As it is critical to minimize the weight of the moving carriage, it uses a different type of rail than the bow. This allows for plastic bushings to guide the carriage long the rail instead of the heavier v-wheels and accompanying hardware. The weight savings allow for faster movements with greater precision and reduced risk of lost steps.",

It dynamically adjusts for the slant of the violin strings, and can lift away from the string. It is extremely light-weight to allow for rapid movements along the lenght of the string. Although it is currently operated by a micro-servo mounted to the sliding carriage, future revisions will be remotely actuated by a cable (similar to cable-actuated bike brake) further minimizing weight while allowing for speed beyond the capabilities of a micro-servo."
